### USER STORY

`- As a new student learning to program`

`- I want a package that will scrape the prices of the S&P 500 index listed stocks` 

`- I want the package to be easy to use`

`- I dont want to have to worry about setting my own rate limiting`

`- I dont want to have to worry about my own data caching`

`- I want to be able to refractor the technology for my own use easily if I wish to do so`

`- I want to satisfy a grading requirement to use a npm package in a application as set by my bootcamp instructors, or university faculty `

### DESCRIPTION
*Add with MVP*


### CHANGELOG


### INSTALLATION


This project was developed with a deployment as a npmjs package in mind. To install this scraper to use in your project, navigate to the directory your project is being written in within your terminal, (you should have ran npm init within your project directory at this point) and run npm install 'sp500-stock-spider' to first install the package using node.

### USAGE


This project was designed to be used by beginners who are starting to expirement with writing their own projects taking advantages of npm packages to aid in their development. This was a way for me to learn more about how one can publish packages for others to use, as I recently graduated my coding Bootcamp and had assignments requiring me to find and use npm packages in my projects. I thought writing a scraper that I could distribute as an npm package would be a fun way to learn more about the technology, and hopefully maybe help another student find an interesting technology to use in their assignments or projects.

### CONTRIBUTING


This project is currently not open to pull requests to the shiny-spider respository, but you are welcome to take the source code and use it responsibly as you wish.

### TESTS


*Consider adding Jest testing before publishing for things like the rate limiting, data caching, and specific results as well. This should have a Jest testing badge added to the README reporting coverage before the push and publishing as well.
