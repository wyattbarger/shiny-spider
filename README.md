### USER STORY

- **As a beginner developer looking into using npm packages in my development to accomplish a variety of tasks:**
  
  - I want a user-friendly package that scrapes the prices of S&P 500 index listed stocks using puppeteer.
  
  - I desire an easy-to-use solution that requires minimal configuration and has clear instructions for customization if desired.
  
  - I would like ethical rate limiting and data caching that will last as long as the server remains running built-in by default, with the rate limit being customizable based on my specific need.
  
  - I aim for a package that allows for easy customization and refactoring for my specific project needs, spelled out in the documentation and installed modules file comments.
  
  - I seek a near plug and play package to help introduce myself to the npm platform as a self taught programmer, or programmer beginning their formal education.

### DESCRIPTION
*Add with MVP*

### INSTALLATION


This project was developed with a deployment as a npmjs package in mind. To install this scraper to use in your project, navigate to the directory your project is being written in within your terminal, (you should have ran npm init within your project directory at this point) and run npm install 'sp500-stock-spider' to first install the package using node.

### USAGE


This project was designed to be used by beginners who are starting to expirement with writing their own projects taking advantages of npm packages to aid in their development. This was a way for me to learn more about how one can publish packages for others to use, as I recently graduated my coding Bootcamp and had assignments requiring me to find and use npm packages in my projects. I thought writing a scraper that I could distribute as an npm package would be a fun way to learn more about the technology, and hopefully maybe help another student find an interesting technology to use in their assignments or projects.

### CONTRIBUTING


This project is currently not open to pull requests to the shiny-spider respository, but you are welcome to take the source code and use it responsibly as you wish.

### TESTS


*Consider adding Jest testing before publishing for things like the rate limiting, data caching, and specific results as well. This should have a Jest testing badge added to the README reporting coverage before the push and publishing as well.
